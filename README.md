# The_ScrambLearner
Project: "Scramble Learner"

Description:
In this game, the player is presented with a jumbled word and they must unscramble it to form the
correct word. Upon successful unscrambling, the game will display the meaning of the word along 
with some other information on the word. The player will be rewarded with points dependening on 
how many guesses they used. When the player reaches enough points the word difficulty increases. 
The losing condition will be stars which will decrease for every word with 3 wrong guesses. When 
the player loses all three stars the game will save the players max points and diplay it on the 
leaderboard.



I wanted to make a little word game to help with learning to program!
