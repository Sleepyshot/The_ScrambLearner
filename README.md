Project: "Scramble Learner"

Description:

correct word.The game will display a definition to help aid the player in getting the correcr The player will 
be rewarded with points dependening on how many guesses they used. When the player reaches enough points the word 
difficulty increases. The player has 3 attempts before they lose a life and move on to another word in the list. 
Once the player reaches zero lives or the word list has ended the game will be over.

I just wanted to create a little game to help solidify some knowledge of basic c# programming!
